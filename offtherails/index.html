  <h1>off the rails</h1>
  <p>Off the Rails is an alternate history mod that I'm making. I don't have a story or a wiki yet but if you have any questions feel free to DM me on Discord below.</p>
  <p>Some of the new nations I added include: Communist Qu√©bec, the Baltic Kingdom, the Uralic Kingdom and Liechtenstein.</p>
  <p>I'm also planning to add the following nations: the Benelux State(fascist), US Civil War/Uprising, White Ruthenian Anarchist State.</p>
