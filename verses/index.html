  <h3>the following verses are taken from the holy bible</h3>
  <p>Leviticus 20:13: If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.</p>
  <p></p>1 Samuel 15:3: Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.</p>
  <p>Hosea 13:16: The people of Samaria must bear their guilt, because they have rebelled against their God. They will fall by the sword; their little ones will be dashed to the ground, their pregnant women ripped open.</p>
  <p>Joshua 6:21: They devoted the city to the Lord and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it—men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys.</p>
  <p>Deuteronomy 20:16-17: However, in the cities of the nations the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes. Completely destroy them—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—as the Lord your God has commanded you.</p>
  <p>Deuteronomy 2:34: At that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed them—men, women and children. We left no survivors.</p>
  <p>Deuteronomy 13:15: You must certainly put to the sword all who live in that town. You must destroy it completely, both its people and its livestock.</p>
  <p>Isaiah 13:15-18: Whoever is captured will be thrust through; all who are caught will fall by the sword. Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted and their wives violated. See, I will stir up against them the Medes, who do not care for silver and have no delight in gold. Their bows will strike down the young men; they will have no mercy on infants, nor will they look with compassion on children.</p>
  <p>Deuteronomy 3:6: We completely destroyed them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying every city—men, women and children.</p>
  <p>Leviticus 25:44-46: Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life.</p>
  <p>1 Peter 2:18: Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.</p>
  <p>Ephesians 6:5: Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.</p>
  <p>1 Timothy 6:1: All who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect, so that God’s name and our teaching may not be slandered.</p>
  <p>Titus 2:9: Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them.</p>
  <p>Colossians 3:22: Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord</p>
